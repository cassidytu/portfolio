                        <p>Climate change is a threat to our whole civilization, with effects that are already prominent and will continue to grow to catastrophic heights unless action is taken now. As one of the biggest challenges to tackle in today’s society, world leaders have come together and agreed on a plan to make the world a greener, fairer, and better place by 2030. But as members of society that necessarily involved, how would we also take steps to help this plan?</p>
                        <h4>How can we make the knowledge needed to combat climate change more accessible and engaging for the general public?</h4>

                        <p>Focusing on two major government funded websites, whose main purpose is to serve the general public, I conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify their issues and how to fix these flaws to attract more of this demographic.</p>

However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to revisit the root problem I'm trying to address, the discoverability of climate action and incentivization of it. My participant provided a different perspective as an individual who wasn't really interested exploring these basic resources of climate action.<br><br>
                        So I began to wonder, <span class="bolded">how can I encourage users and make climate action as easy and fun as possible?</span></p>

I humanized the user and their story, pain points, and behavior, ultimately leading to a better focus on their needs/goals and serve as the foundation for the features of my product that would solve these issues.</p>

                                This is an instance of where the designer (me) has prioritized aesthetics over functionality. I realized that having solid, clear is easier to read.
