                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Climate change is a threat to our whole civilization, with effects that are already prominent and will continue to grow to catastrophic heights unless action is taken now. As one of the biggest challenges to tackle in todayâ€™s society, world leaders have come together and agreed on a plan to make the world a greener, fairer, and better place by 2030. But as members of society that necessarily involved, how would we also take steps to help this plan?</p>
                    <h3>How can we make the knowledge needed to combat climate change more accessible and engaging for the general public?</h3>

                            <h3>Lack of Motivation</h3>
                            <p>Users need extrinsic and intrinsic motivations to encourage their actions, as well as a way to visualize the impact their actions have to lessen the feeling of helplessness. <br>
                            "I don't really pay attention [to climate action] because I don't see the results" <br>
                            "I'm just one individual, I don't necessarily believe I could make a dent"</p>

                            <h3>Efficiency and Engagement</h3>
                            <p>Previous websites were difficult for users to search for specific information with only a single journey path to reach it. Users also found these platforms to be "busy" and too text heavy to be interesting. <br>
                            "That task took a bit longer than I had expected it to" <br>
                            "It was boring and I didn't even look at all of it"</p>

                    <h2>Storytelling</h2>
                    <p>With UX storytelling through multiple components (such as personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps), I was able to put myself into the perspective of the users by considering all these facets of these personas that are representative of the targeted audience. I humanized the user and their story, pain points, and behavior, ultimately leading to a better focus on their needs/goals and serve as the foundation for the features of my product that would solve these issues.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <h3>This was a project created in the course Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design at UCLA. As this was one of my first in-depth UX projects, I learned a lot of new things! </h3>

                        <h2>01</h2>
                        <h3>Research is Key</h3>
                        <p>I didn't realize there was so many different ways to gather data and how each method serves a specific purpose. Learning how a heuristic evaluation provides important, yet different, data compared to a contextual inquiry allowed me to have insight in a multitude of aspects ranging from user behavior to more technical rules of thumb.</p>

                        <h3>Design Preparations</h3>
                        <p>This was my first time creating a design system myself. A cohesive foundation of what spacing, font size, etc. is the backbone of having internal consistency to project design. While time consuming to set up at first, implementing all the details into my design file, it was very helpful during the hi-fi prototyping process and sharing my files with others.</p>
