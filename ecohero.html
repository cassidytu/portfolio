                        <p>Climate change is a threat to our whole civilization, with effects that are already prominent and will continue to grow to catastrophic heights unless action is taken now. As one of the biggest challenges to tackle in today’s society, world leaders have come together and agreed on a plan to make the world a greener, fairer, and better place by 2030. But as members of society that necessarily involved, how would we also take steps to help this plan?</p>

                       <h4><mark>How can we make the knowledge needed to combat climate change more accessible and engaging for the general public?</mark></h4>

                        <p>I didn't realize there was so many different ways to gather data and how <b>each method serves a specific purpose</b>. Learning how a heuristic evaluation provides important, yet different, data compared to a contextual inquiry allowed me to have <b>insight in a multitude of aspects</b> ranging from user behavior to more technical rules of thumb.</p>

While time consuming to set up at first, implementing all the details into my design file, it was very helpful during the hi-fi prototyping process and sharing my files with others.</p>
