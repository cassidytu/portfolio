                    Starting in September 2022, UCLA Humans in User Experience (HUE) worked with La Historia to revamp their website, paying special attention to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        La Historia’s mission of <u>centering and amplifying silenced narratives</u>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        La Historia’s <u>varied audience</u>, which includes high school students, people unaware of local history, and older people with less technological experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        La Historia’s <u>financial and staffing situation</u>, especially after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our research question started coming together...</p>
                <h4>La Historia Museum aims to <mark>connect with its community</mark> by engaging with visitors, donors, and staff. How can we enhance this engagement through an online experience that is <mark>usable, accessible, and representative of the organization</mark>?</h4>
                <p>
                    A round of research including: heuristic evaluation, pilot usability tests (UT), field research, and more were conducted, ultimately leading to the initial prototype.    
                </p>

                    Here’s where Lindsay (my partner in crime) and I joined the story.

                <p>We conducted 10 moderated (a mix of in-person and virtual) usability test sessions to assess the website’s updated design, information architecture, and user flow from the perspective of La Historia organization and community members.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Task 3 required participants to undergo a process of donating and describing a photo to LHHSM through a Google Form. Task 3 took the longest time to complete (mean = 466 seconds) and had the lowest satisfaction rating. While most participants agreed (i.e., agree or strongly agree) the website was easy to use (70%), <mark>only 40% of participants agreed they would use the website frequently</mark>.</p>
                <h4>It seems like we have a few issues to address with this prototype…</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="centered">
                <h3>Check-in Time!</h3>
                <p>We were invited by the LHHSM stakeholders to visit the museum and this was the perfect chance to update them with our progress. We presented our findings and gained insight about what they needed.</p>
                <h4>“Even if we have a beautiful website, it won’t do us any good if it's <mark>not manageable</mark> and the functionality of forms and such <mark>aren’t efficient</mark>.”</h4>
                <p>We brought this concern back to the team and project lead, as well as addressing the pain points we discovered in the data. After bouncing ideas and solutions off of each other, we left with action items to tackle.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="centered">
                    <h2>So, What Changed?</h2>
                    <p>We were able to consolidate all of the pain points under two categories: terminology & instruction and navigation.</p>
                    <h3>01. Terminology & Instruction</h3>
                    <p>Across all tasks, slight language and presentation changes could significantly improve site <mark>clarity and functionality</mark>.</p>
                    <h4>1A: (Task 3) Instructions need to be clear.</h4>
                    <p>We suggested clarifying the donation process, stating that all users should complete the form and expect to receive further contact from the museum on how they will send their materials. We suggested including all of these instructions in the Google Form, and condensed the form so it’s only 2 sections (compared to the previous 12 pages!).</p>

                <div class="centered">
                <h4>1B: (Task 3) Exhibitions Page should encourage users to get involved.</h4>
                <p>Our proposed solution added a leading statement to emphasize the uniqueness of each exhibit. This ranged from subheadings to grab the attention of users, questions to prompt a potential action (e.g., donating a photo, getting in touch with LHHS, or visiting the exhibit in person), etc.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>02. Navigation</h3>
                <p>Usability could be improved by strategically placed call-to-action elements, presenting users with another pathway of a <mark>more localized navigation experience</mark>, instead of only relying on the navigation bar.</p>
                <p>This encourages a seamless exploration of related content, ultimately creating a natural journey throughout the website. The design not only creates more exposure to other pages but also provides users with clear, relevant next steps to follow.</p>

                <p>We added a section to showcase results of donating or supporting to help users visualize their impact and encourage/incentivize them to contribute. The “See Your Contributions in Action!” button leads to the Exhibitions page that contains all the collections to which the donations are attributed to (and more artifacts!). This section can also include more behind the scenes images of digitizing photographs, setting up collections within the museum, etc.</p>

                <p>We proposed adding a “Support Us” section to the bottom of the About page to provide users with a next step to follow when they finish learning about LHHSM. This leads to more exposure to the ways to contribute to the museum, as well as expanding on the feeling of trustworthiness of the organization and inciting excitement to help.</p>
