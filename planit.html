                    <p>Planning the perfect travel itinerary can be a stressful and frustrating process, with pain points ranging from finding places to go, to budgeting, to coordinating timely trip details. These event logistics often require much time and effort, as users have to switch through a multitude of applications like Yelp, Calendars, etc. to create the perfect itinerary.</p>

                                We were able to identify problem points that weren’t considered before such as what needed to be shown to users when scheduling events with a time conflict. We then planned to present a warning message, notifying users to prevent any errors.</p>

                            <p>Calendars need less clutter and minimal features to appear less overwhelming and better navigate users. <br><br>
                            Maps performed best on sites when used on a smaller interface, but needed additional features, including the ability to search through the map, pinpoint events from the database, and expansion.</p>

                    <h2>Design + Ideation</h2>
                    <p>A major challenge in designing was ensuring that our designs were appropriately suited for a limited development cycle. This meant designing around development limitations such as a limited user scheduling window, no infinite scroll requiring pagination, and a maximum trip length of one week.<br>
                    To prepare working as a cohesive team across different schedules, locations, and committees, we set up a design system. In addition, we research accessibility standards to ensure our design was AAA WCAG complainant.<br>
                    With the single page layout, we first worked to create a wireframe to get a sense of what the placement of the features would look like. We then moved on to prototypes, focusing on the overall layout, information hierarchy, and interactions that would be completed. <br>
                    After continuous modifications and communication with the developers, PlanIt was fully designed to handoff to developers. While the dev team worked on the application, we continued to execute an interactive hi-fi prototype to prepare for future steps in usability testing.</p>

                            <p>This was my first time working so closely with a development team and I learned about the process of creating a product. Our project was designed and developed simultaneously, so our team learned how to communicate design choices to developers frequently. I actively participated in conversations to explain and defend my design decisions, while trying to find the perfect compromise.</p>
