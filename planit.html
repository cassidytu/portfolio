                    <p>With the single page layout, we first worked to create a wireframe to get a sense of what the placement of the features would look like. We then moved on to prototypes, focusing on the <b>overall layout, information hierarchy, and interactions</b> that would be completed. After continuous modifications and communication with the developers, PlanIt was fully designed to handoff to developers.</p>

                            <p>This was my first time working so closely with a development team and I learned about the process of creating a product. Our project was designed and developed simultaneously, so our team learned how to communicate design choices to developers frequently. I actively participated in conversations to explain and defend my design decisions, while trying to find the perfect compromise.</p>

                            <p>A major challenge in designing PlanIt was ensuring that our designs were appropriately suited for a limited development cycle. This meant designing around development limitations such as a limited user scheduling window, a max trip length of one week, etc. However, we tried our best and I am very proud of what we created!</p>
