                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The problem at hand was to assess the usability of the EXOTIC Software tutorial and how appealing it was to the targeted audience of users with less knowledge and experience with astronomy, specifically in the age range of high school to college students. The tutorial serves as a bridge for these users to be introduced and learn about how to get involved with discovering exoplanets through the software. Therefore, exploring their reactions and feedback to the tutorial is vital to user engagement, retention, and participation, which is the overall goal of our client.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We conducted usability testing interviews with seven college students; six of these participants had little to no experience with astronomy and one had an education in aerospace engineering. Of the seven participants, three had never used Jupyter notebooks before the usability testing interview.</p>
                    <p>Each interview was conducted using a standard script of questions and tasks. The interviews were conducted on Zoom, where participants shared their screens with the interview facilitators. We recorded data using an internal-facing Google Form with all of our questions, and these interviews were also recorded for future reference.</p>

                            <h4>Lack of information hierarchy</h4>
                            <p>Users who had never used Jupyter notebook were immediately intimidated by all the information. Other users overestimated the amount of time the tutorial would take to run because of the length text. <br><br>
                            “What the f*** is this?” (P5) <br>
                            “It's so many words, I feel like I don't even know where to start reading.” (P6)</p>

                            <p>Users did not understand when/where to input values and could not interpret the end results presented. Terminology was confusing for everyone, regardless of experience. <br><br>
                            “A lot of things are happening, there are a lot of numbers I don't know, it looks fancy.” (P2) <br>

                            <p>Users plugged in numbers and followed instructions, but were not confident in replicating this process with new data. <br><br>
                            “I don’t know if I could do this by myself.” (P3)</p>

                            “Whenever it comes to videos embedded, I never really watch them.” (P4)</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>Due to the nature of the project and timeline, creating prototypes was outside our scope and we were not able to meet with developers to discuss/make any further changes. However, our client’s person of contact received our research and mentioned that it had supported previous concerns about the tutorial user experience. In the future, we hope to see these recommendations on the tutorial!</p>

                        <p>We were able to provide our insights confidently in front of our client's team due to the supporting evidence that we found. It also felt nice to be validated as past research companies have found similar findings as us!</p>

                        <h4>Knowledge Limitations</h4>
                        <p>We came into the project without any knowledge of the software/platform and astronomy in general, which ultimately affected and slowed the project. Moving forward, understanding more about Jupyter Notebook, EXOTIC, and lightcurves + exoplanets or talking to devs/experts would be very helpful to providing realistic recommendations.</p>
