                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>The problem at hand was to <span class="bolded">assess the usability</span> of the EXOTIC Software tutorial and how appealing it was to the targeted audience of users with <span class="bolded">less knowledge and experience</span> with astronomy, specifically in the age range of high school to college students. The tutorial serves as a bridge for these users to be introduced and learn about how to get involved with discovering exoplanets through the software. Therefore, exploring their reactions and feedback to the tutorial is vital to user <span class="bolded">engagement, retention, and participation</span>, which is the overall goal of our client.</p>
                        <h4>Novice users of EXOTIC would have difficulty understanding the tutorial’s terms and purpose, and would therefore be less engaged than expert users.</h4>

                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p style="margin-left:-50%">Due to the nature of the project and timeline, creating prototypes was outside our scope and we were not able to meet with developers to discuss/make any further changes. However, our client’s person of contact received our research and mentioned that it had supported previous concerns about the tutorial user experience. In the future, we hope to see these recommendations on the tutorial!</p>

                    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
                    <p>Based on our research, we suggested phase-by-phase recommendations of the EXOTIC tutorial to our client that we would've implemented to improve the overall user experience. We presented a written report and presentation to our client's person of contact, documenting our entire process and recommendations, including the various graphs and charts that illustrated the research and analysis we had conducted. Part of the presentation has been included below as a preview into our suggestions.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We conducted usability testing interviews with seven college students; six of these participants had little to no experience with astronomy and one had an education in aerospace engineering. Of the seven participants, three had never used Jupyter notebooks before the usability testing interview.</p>
                    <p>Each interview was conducted using a standard script of questions and tasks. The interviews were conducted on Zoom, where participants shared their screens with the interview facilitators. We recorded data using an internal-facing Google Form with all of our questions, and these interviews were also recorded for future reference.</p>

                            <p>We came into the project without any knowledge of the software/platform and astronomy in general, which ultimately affected and slowed the project. Moving forward, understanding more about Jupyter Notebook, EXOTIC, and lightcurves + exoplanets or talking to devs/experts would be very helpful to providing realistic recommendations.</p>
